TODO
----

- make tree.Factory implement the classification.Factory interface
- Try to split out crossvalidation into its own package.
- Implement logit regression.
- Merge the "stop" package into "tree"?  Or make it a sub-package of tree?
- Make the digits dataset download the data and store it in some cache
  directory.  Add more datasets.
- systematically compare the performance to:
  * https://github.com/ryanbressler/CloudForest
  * R packages
  * scikit learn
- For assessment of methods, treat fixed-size data sets and generated
  data sets differently, use cross-validation where needed.
- Add the Fisher's Iris data set, because it is so popular.
