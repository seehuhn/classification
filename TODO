- Make tree.Factory implement the classification.Factory interface?
- Try to split out crossvalidation into its own package.
- Implement logit regression.
- Merge the "stop" package into "tree"?  Or make it a sub-package of tree?
- Make the digits dataset download the data and store it in some cache
  directory.  Add more datasets.
