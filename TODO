TODO
----

- Rename `tree.NewFromTrainingData` to `tree.FromTrainingData`?
- Make tree.Builder and classification.Factory be the same?  Also,
  decide whether it's "Builder" or "Factory" or something else.
- add a new `rows` argument to all `FromTrainingData` functions?
- maybe use a struct to collect all arguments of `FromTrainingData`?
- try to move crossvalidation out into its own package
- implement logit regression
- merge the "stop" package into "tree"?
- make the digits dataset download the data and store it in some cache
  directory.  Add more datasets.
